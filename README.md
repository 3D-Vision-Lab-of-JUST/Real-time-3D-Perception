## Real-time-3D-Perception
This is a real-time 3D perception system that includes 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation, and real-time rendering with a multi-resolution voxel space.

Thanks to bundlefusion(https://github.com/niessner/BundleFusion) for its great contribution, some of our code comes from them.

We tested our code on:
- DirectX SDK June 2010
- NVIDIA CUDA 11.5 (>=8.0)
- Realsense SDK2.0
- our research library mLib, a git submodule in external/mLib
- mLib external libraries can be downloaded [here](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/mLib/mLibExternal.zip)
- Intel OpenVINO 2021.4.689
- Opencv with OpenVINO

Optional:
